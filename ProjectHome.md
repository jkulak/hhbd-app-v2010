This is a repository for Polish hip-hop website (http://www.hhbd.pl).

[Check application chagelog](http://code.google.com/p/hhbdevolution/source/browse/trunk/doc/changelog)

It's a rewritten version from good old structural PHP application. I did new PHP (using Zend Framework), HTML, CSS, JS. Databases are left as were (so ugly SQL queries are found in models' APIs). I plan to rewrite databases, sometime in the future.

My goal was to release this version in 2010 and I did it :)

All code reviews, and suggestions are welcome.

## Tools I'm using ##
  * Textmate  for coding
  * Mac OS X Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera for browsing/testing
  * Balsamiq (a little for sketching layouts)
  * Versions and Terminal for SVN
  * iTunes :)

## Instalation ##
  1. set .httaccess
  1. set applcaition/configs/application.ini (database, baseUrl)
  1. make symbolic link to Zend libraries
  1. make symbolic link to image content
